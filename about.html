            <p>"I am Priyadharshini, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Arunai Engineering College. 
                Throughout my academic tenure, I specialized in UI/UX design, utilizing tools like Figma and Principle.
                 I also excelled in frontend development, particularly in HTML and CSS. Noteworthy projects include a mobile
                  app prototype aimed at enhancing the shopping experience and a responsive website for a local charity organization.
                   These projects showcased my ability to translate design concepts into functional and user-friendly interfaces. 
                   My education at Arunai Engineering College provided me with invaluable experiences,
                 fostering both knowledge and practical skills in software development."</p>
